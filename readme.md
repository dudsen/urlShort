Python project that will end up as a url shortener nobody should use. It exists solely because i wanted to know the inner mechanics of how an url shortener could work and writing one is a good way to teach yourself the hidden complecity of what is otherwise fairly simple stuff. 

Python and sqlite3 because anthing else would be too cool for me to handle.
